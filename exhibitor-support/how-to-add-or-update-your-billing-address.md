# ðŸ“© How to Add or Update your Billing Address

#### Overview

This article will review how to update your billing address to your credit card in ShowGroundsLive. A billing address may not always be required by all Show Companies, so it is possible to have a card without the billing address to work on transactions for one company, and not the other.

If you are receiving this error message upon trying to check out for an Entry into the show, this indicates the cardâ€™s billing address is either missing information or not correct.
